# Sentence-Creation
CIS477 Group Project

                    Overview

BERT is a cutting-edge, state of the art odel that builds upon previous versions.

Things to do/Breakdown 
    Repo should contain: 
        - code used to solve the problem
        - requirements.txt with list of python libs used and how to install them
        - documents folder: holds images or diagrams generated
        - code files: used to run the experiment and solve the problem
        - front end for the user to see and interact with

        

    ReadMe Needs:
        - how to install python libs
        - guide on how to run the project (commands needed)
        - summary of what it does
        - ML models used and what they are doing
        - Metrics section


ReadMe Info:

    Problem:
        Create a model that would take a given sentence with a "mask" word and return a list of words that could potentially replace the masked work.


    Summary

    Requirements
        Some things you need to pip install to run the code/model (all these can be found in the requirements folder)

        pip install tokenizer

    Models
        Will be using a pre-trained BERT language model from hugging face. It is pre-trained on two datasets. Also provide info about what they are doing.

    Metrics
        how well the model did on the training data and eval data; used a seperate dataset from hugging face for fine-tuning and seeing how well the model did.
